# raspi-tools
A collection of tools &amp; tutorials for getting started with the Raspberry Pi :)

Written (very quickly) with vanilla PHP & MySQL because it was what I knew best and I wanted to make it quickly.

Code isn't amazing but it does the job. I will do my best to keep it backwards compatible as I (slowly) refactor.

Latest (master) build is running on https://bpmct.net/projects/raspi

## Run this on your server:

A simple LAMP stack is required. Create a database and copy `db-conf.example.php` to `db-conf.php`. Then change database details. Import the tables structure by using the `tables.sql` file in MySQL Cli or PHPMyAdmin.
